# n - create files and folders quickly

Create files and folders quickly with relative paths. It's like Sublime's AdvancedNewFile plugin but for your terminal.

> Note: this is homebrew experimental software that will probably break your computer.

## Usage

```bash
n [path to file or folder]
```

### Example

```bash
n the_spy/who_came_in_from_the_cold.txt
```

```
 .
  └──  who_came_in_from_the_cold.txt
```
